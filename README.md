====================

<p>Generated APKs are dumped in the <code>apk</code> directory</p>
<p>You can change the app title and base URL in the following file:</p>
<h3>webview_shim/res/values/config.xml</h3>
<p>The app icon is located in:</p>
<h3>webview_shim/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png</h3>
<b>Do not modify dimensions of the icon!</b>
<p>If you have the android SDK setup, just run <code>build.sh</code> to build a new APK</p>
